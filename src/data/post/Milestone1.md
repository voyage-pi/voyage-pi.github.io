### Problem

Travelers often struggle to plan personalized trips due to a lack of local knowledge, an overwhelming number of choices, and the challenge of finding and planing activities aligned with their preferences and time frames.

- Planning an itinerary requires gathering details from multiple sources, making it hard to create a good travel plan;
- Travel plans often don’t take into account external factors like weather, transportation and overall logistics leading to poor experiences;
- The vast number of online options leads to decision fatigue, making it difficult to select activities that best align with the user’s vision;
