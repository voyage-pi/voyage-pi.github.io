- **Jo√£o**: Covers from Slide 5 to the end

## 3. üìù Observations and Comments

### **Slide 1**

- Team members
- Supervisors
- Quick presentation introduction
- Product name; what it is (brief explanation)

### **Slide 2**

- We conducted a small study to validate the concept
    - We received **X** responses
    - We asked **X** types of questions
        - About travel habits
    - We asked about features users would like in a travel planning app
        - **Include graphs in the slide**

### **Slide 3**

- **Story**
    - Traveling to a destination
    - Likely have a budget I don‚Äôt want to exceed
    - Choosing flights/transport
    - Example of **lack of knowledge**
        - Travelers have to spend time searching for places they would enjoy because they don‚Äôt know the location
    - Example of **overwhelm**
        - When looking for places to visit, there are **hundreds or thousands** of options, which can be confusing or even stressful
    - Among all these options, it is difficult to plan a trip that:
        - Stays within budget
        - Makes sense in terms of scheduling
        - Aligns with the traveler‚Äôs goals

### **Slide 4**

- **How are we solving this problem?**
    - We are creating a **web platform** to address these challenges
- **What are we doing?**
    - Reducing the effort needed to plan a trip by delivering exactly what the user wants
    - Creating personalized itineraries based on user preferences, while adapting to external factors such as local and seasonal trends
    - Simplifying **budgeting** by consolidating all necessary elements into a single platform
        - **Potential question:** What exactly does budgeting cover? Museums? Flights? Hotels?
- **Focus**
    - Ensuring **simple and intuitive user flows** to maintain user engagement

### **Slide 5**

- **Competitor research**
    - We analyzed existing market solutions
    - Our competitor analysis table highlights different features
    - Based on our survey results, there is currently **no** solution that includes all the features identified as important by participants
    - We propose developing a **comprehensive** solution that integrates all these features

### **Slide 6**

- **High-level architecture**
    - We will pull data from multiple **external APIs** (e.g., Google Maps, TripAdvisor)
    - This data will be used in our **AI models** for itinerary generation and recommendations
    - **Data Collection**
        - Normalizes data from external APIs so it can be processed by our models
    - **Trip Management Service**
        - Manages interactions between both AI modules
        - **Core business logic** of the application
        - **(More details might be needed here)**
    - **User Service**
        - Manages user profiles and stores preferences
    - **User Interface**
